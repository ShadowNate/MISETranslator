IMPORTANT NOTICE:

When upgrading to 4.9 from a previous version, make sure to keep your old trampol.sqlite db file, 
if you already have submitted translation sessions.

You can overwrite the trampol.sqlite in the translator's directory, but it's recommended 
that this is done when the translator application is not running.

If the translator application can't detect an existing trampol.sqlite db, it will try to copy a clean db from the cleandb folder, 
in order to continue with the application's execution.
